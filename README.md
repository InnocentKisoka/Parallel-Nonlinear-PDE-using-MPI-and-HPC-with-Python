# Parallel-Nonlinear-PDE-using-MPI-and-HPC-with-Python


Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a parallel solver for Fisher’s equation using MPI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) with Python. The project builds on previous work with OpenMP and introduces ghost cell exchanges for inter-process communication in distributed computing environments.

Features

MPI-based parallel solver for Fisher’s equation

Ghost cell exchange mechanism for efficient inter-process communication

Domain decomposition and optimization strategies

Python-based HPC solutions for scientific computing

Parallel Mandelbrot set computation with self-scheduling
